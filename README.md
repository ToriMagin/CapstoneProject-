### Business Problem 
A consultancy firm is hired by a government health department to provide insights on factors that influence life expectancy. This analysis will attempt to:
Predict life expectancy by examining positive and negatively correlated health and societal features of different countries. 
Serves as an example for countries to assess to improve life expectancy for their citizens.



### The Data 

The  World Health Organisation’s (WHO) Life Expectancy dataset was used for this analysis. 
The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under WHO keeps track of the health, social, and economic factors for all countries. 
The publicly available dataset provides data for 193 countries spanning from 2000 to year 2015 and is structured in 2938 rows (data points) which are characterised into 22 columns (features).
